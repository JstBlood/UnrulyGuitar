## Beginning of the meeting

Attendance on today's meeting: Michael, Maddy, Miko≈Çaj, Matiss, Bogdan, Vlad.

Everyone is doing well!

## TODO

- Madeline does mock drawings for HUE (keep them simple and easy to understand).
- Fix drag and drop issues 
- Change certain aspects of the UI: color theme is a bit overwhelming, try to make it more clear and intuitive.
- Test the client-side with mockito!
- Usernames are fine!!! (finally got a proper answer)
- Product pitch advice: try to showcase every feature of the app. All of us should speak and present features.
- Self reflection advice: make it clean.
- More reviews on the MRs: try to assign specific people.

## Formative feedback notes

1. Tasks and planning : 
	a) Road map is really nice! Some notes:
		- Try to update it frequently.
		- Add time estimates and time spent. 
		- Add what we expect to do in the following weeks and after the week is over add what we actually did. 
	b) Everyone should implement at least a full feature (backend + frontend)!

2. HUE report : 
	a) Mention that evaluators had multiple, smaller flows, not just one big flow when evaluating. (read the feedback for more details)

3. Technology : 
	a) Have long polling SOMEWHERE!

## Conclusions

- We have only 10 days left to code, therefore everyone should put in the time and work, such that we have a nice app in the end.
  (please!)

- We should also focus more (a lot more) on the other aspects of the project, such as HUE, product pitch and the road map (we should
  assign someone to constantly update it!). 

- Always read the group chat (it's not that hard...) and communicate properly your intentions, work done and any issues you have. Ask
  for help whenever needed!
