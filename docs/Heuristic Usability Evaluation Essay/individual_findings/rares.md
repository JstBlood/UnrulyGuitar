Visibility of system status
It’s not clear whether I’m logged as an admin or not.
It’s not clear that I’m allowed to change the name of the lists
There is no save button for the board name/The name doesn’t automatically save
The board key should be filled with the last joined board

User control and freedom
The return button from board view should be made more obvious.
The return button is missing from create card.
There is no return button from settings.
Should prompt the user when deleting lists

Color coding adding and removing cards could prevent incidents.

Error prevention
I get HTTP 400 bad request when trying to create a new list with no name, a normal user doesn’t know what to do in this case
Recognition rather than recall
The labels are visible when adding them to a task

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
I get HTTP 400 bad request when trying to create a new list with no name, a normal user doesn’t know what to do in this case.

Help and documentation
There is no documentation, however, create task should include
