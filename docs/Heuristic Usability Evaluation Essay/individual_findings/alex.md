1. Visibility of system status:

When adding a list or a board, the application switches between full-screen and normal mode, causing confusion.

The background application disappears when an error message is displayed while adding a list with an empty name.

2. Match between system and the real world:

Unclear error messages appear when entering an invalid hostname (e.g., DeploymentException, UnresolvedAddressException).

3. User control and freedom:

Fields in the login screen do not get cleared when navigating to another screen and returning.

No option to remove lists.

No cancel button for adding a task.

Can log in as the same user multiple times on the same computer.

4. Consistency and standards:

Unable to connect through 127.0.0.1, but can connect through "localhost."

Inconsistent full-screen behavior when adding a list or a card.

The boards are not displayed in the same order for everyone in the board selection list.

5. Error prevention:

Users can log in with a username consisting only of spaces.

Boards, lists, and tasks can be added with empty names (only spaces).

Can add non-time values to the time field of a task.

Users can have long usernames with special characters and spaces.

6. Recognition rather than recall:

The application requires both the IP address and port number for connection, which can be confusing.

Joining a board using a large key number is difficult to remember and differentiate between available boards.

Unclear icon for the time field of a task; could be highlighted more by adding some text to highlight the meaning of the field, same for location.

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:

Joining a board using a large key number might be confusing and inefficient for users who need to search for a specific board among many.

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:

The settings menu of a board has uninformative fields (e.g., option1 and option2) without clear explanations.

Some fields for adding a task do not provide enough context.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:

When trying to join as an administrator without providing a password, a 404 error message is displayed, which can be unclear and unexpressive for users.

Error messages regarding empty-named lists in the board menu are unclear for inexperienced users.

10. Help and documentation:

The application lacks documentation and help features, making it difficult for users to understand how to use the system effectively or troubleshoot issues they may encounter.
