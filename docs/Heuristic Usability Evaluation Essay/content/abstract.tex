This essay was written as a report concerning the Heuristic Usability Evaluation of the product "Unruly Guitar", conducted in independent runs by heuristic usability experts. The central question of the evaluation was how usable the product was for users of any level of technical knowledge. The evaluators were supervised by M. Gazeel and V. DrÄƒgutoiu, as to ensure their reports were in accordance with several usability heuristics that they outlined. Individual findings were analysed and aggregated into a collective report by M. Berzins and B. Micu.
