# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Bogdan Micu
Minute taker: Michael Frota Fokkens

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Try to write who is the chairman and the minute taker in the agenda so it becomes clearer.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was sent in time (even tho on the wrong platform, you should try to upload them to GitLab from now on), and the format was the right one, although again I recommend having the chairperson and minute taker mentioned and customize more the template (you do not have to have everything in there if you feel there is no need to) + add time estimates instead of time frames since the order might differ and so on.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I cannot see the notes from the 2nd meeting in the agenda file, please make sure to upload it next time.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: You ensured everything on the agenda was covered and it is allocated a lot of time, even moved things outside the meeting time to make full benefit of the meeting. I think you had some periods when happened nothing before the meeting ended, those can be further improved by minimizing the stalling times.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: You had ownership of the meeting and had a constructive team atmosphere, but I felt like not everyone was involved in the meeting. Even tho you might be shy, please try to contribute to the meeting.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have not started coding yet, but we strongly advise you to start as soon as possible and make sure it works on your setup.
