# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Madeline
Minute taker: Mikolaj

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The points were clear, maybe some discussions did not make sense to have during the TA meeting because those are internal conversations, but as for time usage you were going good (except for the assumption that the meeting is 1h, in the end it did not take that much time). One more thing to add to the agenda is a demo for some one.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I could not find the minutes from last week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone was involved and the chair was in full control of the meeting and made sure you are not stuck on some point.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: You had a good attitude and ownership of the meeting and the atmosphere was constructive. One thing I would recommend is to try to have a more equal distribution of speaking, even tho everyone is involved.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You seem on track for the shippable product and I really liked your UI.
