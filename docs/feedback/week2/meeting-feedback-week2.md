# Week 2

## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Dragutoiu Vlad
- **Notetaker**: Berzins Matiss

### Meeting Organization
Mark: Pass 

### Agenda 
Mark: Good

Feedback: You sent the agenda before the meeting, but I suggest you will do it sooner to let others double-check it and make sure you all agree. It was nice that you followed the template. You can add the chairman and minute-taker to the agenda to make it more clear.

### Chair performance
Mark: Good

Feedback: I felt like you were in charge of the meeting and other members listen. Also, a lot of points were discussed that were not on the agenda and you deviate a lot from the subject with unrelated things. I would suggest next time adapt to the agenda on what you want to talk about and not blindly talk copy-paste the template, as it is a guideline, not a template (for example the opening of 5 minutes). As another improvement, I would write time estimates instead of time intervals, but however, you like it better.

#### Relation
Mark: Good

Feedback: Maybe because you got a new team member, it was hard to catch them up to date and still talk equally, but you did a good job including them and you can further make sure everyone talks 'equal' amount of time during meetings (excepting the chair).
