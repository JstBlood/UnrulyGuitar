### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Fail

Feedback: Please make sure that you have only the submission file placed in the location indicated by the assignment.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: I liked the structure and how you covered everything in the backlog, it was really comprehensive.

### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I would try to find specific epics to the project, not only the Moscok method for prioritization (check the assignment description).  Also, I would try to make sure the mocks are used throughout the document to improve the points being made.

### User Stories

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: In my opinion, you do not follow the required user story format, but the scope of the stories seems right.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: For most 'user stories', were granular and their effect is clear and measurable, but make sure you follow the actual format and be careful to still keep them concise and clear.
