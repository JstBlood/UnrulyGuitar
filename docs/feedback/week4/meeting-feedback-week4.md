# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Miko≈Çaj Gazeel
Minute taker: Madeline

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was delivered on time and the individual points were clear. You might want to make the time estimate more realistic and try to fill up the meeting or end it short if you find it appropriate and try to mention it in the agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The notes do not have everything it was talked about and some important agreements are missing. I know you were sick and that came with its drawbacks, I would suggest next time if one of you feels bad swap roles for that meeting. Moreover, the meeting notes were not merged into the agenda file, please do so from now on.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: All topics were covered in the appropriate amount of time. I would suggest not being so easily distracted by random stuff and keeping the discussion only about the meeting points, this might keep everyone more engaged.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You had ownership of the meeting and have nice discussions about the technical aspects of your project and listened to each other. I felt like some of you were not fully engaged in the discussion. I would try to include everyone in the discussions more if I notice they are disengaged or try to turn off the other devices if not used for the meeting.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have not started coding yet, but we strongly advise you to start as soon as possible and deliver code that works on the main and present a demo every week from this point on.
