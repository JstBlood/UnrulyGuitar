# Code Contributions and Code Reviews


#### Focused Commits

Grade: Good

Feedback: In general good job, the commits seem to change a small number of files and the namings are concise (with a few outliers from time to time such as "fix" and some are too long "functionality for adding subtasks is added, the only problem is that you cant see them but shhhhhhh" or "functionality of adding tags depending on the Set<Tag> of the parent board, and submitting created cards"), which are too long or too short.


#### Isolation

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: The MRs seem to have a large scope and focus on big functionalities or even on multiple functionalities.


#### Reviewability

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: The title or the MRs is suggestive in most cases and the descriptions are really good, but they do not seem granular and contain a big number of changes (for example "Implemented the "Add card list" feature" could be split into multiple MRs that cover different functionalities of this feature - for example, creating just the scenes, just the frontend or just the backend, not the entire functionality in just 1 MR).


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Good

Feedback: The reviews seem to improve the code and be appropriate, making the app better. You have some reviews with no comments (or just LGTM), but in general, the reviews seem really good and lead to improvements, while having the appropriate amount of discussion. The only problem I could find is that not everyone does the reviews, so I recommend all of you evenly review MR and make comments.


#### Build Server


Grade: Excellent

Feedback: Your pipeline seems to pass and it takes not too much time, while you have selected appropriate checkstyle rules. Good job!
