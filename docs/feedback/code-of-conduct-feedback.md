# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You correctly put a single file in the right place, but the naming is not completely right.


### General

Mark: Good

Overall, I think you have done a good job in most of the sections, the improvements would be individually in the sub-sections.


### Assignment Description

Mark: Good

Feedback: The assignment you wrote sounds good, but it would be nice to have all the deliverables for the project listed in this section and also have more details.

### Products

Mark: Good

Feedback: You have the quality of the work submitted, but you have not provided a clear overview of all details of the work submitted.

### Planning

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You plan to use GitLab features, which will simplify your work a lot and will allow for a clear overview.

### Communication

Mark: Good

Feedback: You seem to have a detailed overview of the communication channel and what you will send on every channel 


### Commitment

Mark: Good

Feedback: The metrics sound good, maybe giving more specific metrics and ways to measure the work would improve the assessment part.


### Division of Tasks and Roles

Mark: Good

Feedback: The way to divide tasks and roles sound reasonable, you can look into creating GitLab issues for creating agendas and adding the notes for example to make it clearer to everyone.

### Meetings
  
Mark: Good

Feedback: You have described how you will conduct the non-TA meetings as well (it is not clear that the chair for the TA meeting will be the same for all meetings in that week) and scheduling time slots every week where you could meet would be optimal to have consistency.

### Decision Making
  
Mark: Good

Feedback: It sounds like a reasonable way to reach a consensus, but I do not fully understand how I will be involved and also what you do in case someone will really not agree with the other option (just suppress their opinion?).

### Dealing with Conflicts
  
Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: In my opinion, there is no clear agreements are used in case of conflicts (which section refers to what to do in case of a fight).

### Guidance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: We have discussed this together and sounds good to me.

### Consequences

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You wrote some general consequences but you did not differentiate between the gravity of them so that will make for example being 5 minutes late equally bad as missing an entire meeting, which is not optimal. 

### Success Factors

Mark: Good

Feedback: This sounds really good and seems to relate a lot to your team.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: The criteria sound good, but you have no argument why you consider them important for your team.
