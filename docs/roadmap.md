*Mikolaj Gazeel, Vlad Dragontiou, Madeline Sebastian, Michael da Rocha Frota Fokkens, Bogdan Micu, Matiss Berzins*

## Description

This roadmap is an outline for the overall distribution and planning of the user stories, which themselves were derived from the user epics during the first few weeks. Every week, the user stories specified in the roadmap will be distrubuted into concrete tasks, which will then be assigned and planned. The activity, i.d. which tasks were assigned to which people, can be found in the minute taker notes, as well as in the GitLab history.

## Note: unexpected issues

Often, during the completion of a task, a member of the team will stumble upon an unplanned problem, or will remark that a certain task was missed some time ago and should be done as soon as possible to catch up. In this case, a task will simply be created as an Issue on the GitLab page, not per se related to the user stories that were planned for resolutiont during that week.
